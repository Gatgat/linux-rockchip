Rockchip specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware HDMI
================================

Required properties:
- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-dw-hdmi";

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length
- reg-io-width: the width of the reg:1,2,4
- ddc-i2c-bus: the ddc i2c bus
- clocks: from common clock binding: handle to hdmi clock.
	of memory mapped region.
- clock-names: from common clock binding:
	Required elements: "iahp" "isfr"
- gpr: this soc should set GRF regs, so need get grf here.

- ports: contain a port node with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:
hdmi: hdmi@ff980000 {
                compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-dw-hdmi";
                reg = <0xff980000 0x20000>;
                reg-io-width = <4>;
		ddc-i2c-bus = <&i2c5>;
                gpr = <&grf>;
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 103 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                clocks = <&cru  PCLK_HDMI_CTRL>, <&cru SCLK_HDMI_HDCP>;
                clock-names = "iahb", "isfr";
                status = "disabled";
                ports {
                        hdmi_in: port {
                                #address-cells = <1>;
                                #size-cells = <0>;
                                hdmi_in_vopb: endpoint@0 {
                                        reg = <0>;
                                        remote-endpoint = <&vopb_out_hdmi>;
                                };
                                hdmi_in_vopl: endpoint@1 {
                                        reg = <1>;
                                        remote-endpoint = <&vopl_out_hdmi>;
                                };
                        };
                };
        };
